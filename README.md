# Hangman game
Just a simple game built using Python.

## Considerations
The intention of this repository, is to upgrade from the most simple solution to become a better solution, using design patterns (if qualify) and software architecture. Stay tuned for new updates!

## Inspirations
This game is inspirated by the course [Curso de Python Intermedio](https://platzi.com/clases/python-intermedio/).
